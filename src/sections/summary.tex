\section*{Summary}
Experienced in building modern web apps using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and up-to-date development practices. I focus on delivering responsive, user-friendly, and scalable solutions.

I enjoy turning designs into smooth, functional applications and love working in teams to get things done right. Recently, I’ve been exploring backend development—especially with Rust—and enjoy tackling challenges across the full stack.
